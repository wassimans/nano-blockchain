# Nano Blockchain

A naive Proof of Work blockchain implementation in Typescript, where the blockchain nodes are web clients accessed through a web browser, and they are communicating with each other through WebSocket via a server that handles and dispatches the messages.

Quite a naive approche, just for fun and learning.

A work in progress, more details on the project to come.

## Usage

```shell
# compile the client and server Typescript source code
npm run build

# run the client and server in watch mode
npm run start
```

- Open two or more browser windows connected to http://localhost:3000 and start interacting.
